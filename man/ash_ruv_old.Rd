\title{Perform RUV to estimate confounders, estimate scale using simple
MLE, run ash.}
\usage{
ash_ruv_old(Y, X, ctl, k = NULL, cov_of_interest = ncol(X),
  ash_args = list(), include_intercept = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A matrix of numerics. These are the response variables
where each column has its own variance. In a gene expression
study, the rows are the individuals and the columns are the
genes.}

\item{X}{A matrix of numerics. The covariates of interest.}

\item{ctl}{A vector of logicals of length \code{ncol(Y)}. If
position i is \code{TRUE} then position i is considered a
negative control.}

\item{k}{A non-negative integer.The number of unobserved
confounders. If not specified and the R package sva is
installed, then this function will estimate the number of
hidden confounders using th methods of Buja and Eyuboglu
(1992).}

\item{cov_of_interest}{A positive integer. The column number of
covariate in X whose coefficients you want to apply ASH to.}

\item{ash_args}{A list of arguments to pass to ash. See
\code{\link{ash.workhorse}} for details.}

\item{include_intercept}{A logical. If \code{TRUE}, then it will
check \code{X} to see if it has an intercept term. If not, then
it will add an intercept term. If \code{FALSE}, then \code{X}
will be unchanged.}
